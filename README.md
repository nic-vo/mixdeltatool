# SuperUser Actions

Welcome! For now this is a Spotify-only tool and it'll probably remain that way for a while.

This will essentially be a glorified playlist cleanup / diffing / combining tool.

## Changelog (the commit history sucks because this started out as an experiment)

### 0.2.0
  - Begin to reduce the amount of data returned to user from Spotify API through the handler
  - Begin to compartmentalize state related to playlists

### 0.1.0
  - Initial commit
  - Next-auth + small modifications to the signIn flow to allow for API interaction
